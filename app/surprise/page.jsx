          I didnâ€™t know how, when or why â€” but you slowly became a part of me.
          From silly chats to quiet thoughts, you've stayed on my mind longer
          than youâ€™d believe. I never told you enough, but I genuinely like you.
          Youâ€™re beautiful â€” inside and out â€” and your presence has made my days
          warmer. On your birthday, I just want to say â€” you deserve the kind of
          happiness you never have to question. Happy Birthday again, Aloo.
          You're unforgettable.I can never love anybody like you.
