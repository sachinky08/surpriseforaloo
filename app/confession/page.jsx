  "When you finally said you liked me too, it felt like all those quiet years suddenly made sense.",
  "That day on ashatmi ‚Äî when you held my hand crossing the road ‚Äî I swear that moment will stay with me forever.",
  "That line ‚Äî 'you matter to me after my parents' ‚Äî broke me, beautifully.",
